      <description>Sound + Single-Channel Video, Loop, 21mins&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Quarry, Ballyneety&amp;rsquo; is a quiet voice + signal-processing performance responding to a limestone quarry in County Limerick, and the ecology now flourishing in its man-made habitat (sand martins, jackdaws, buzzards, hares among them). The calls of a peregrine falcon interrupt the performance. The piece was captured using a stereo pair of high-sensitivity mics, Zoom recorder and a DSLR camera.&#xA;The piece was exhibited as part of &amp;lsquo;The Limerick Show&amp;rsquo; at Ormston House, 29th Nov 2024 to 1st Feb 2025.</description>

      <title>Ireland (for desktop wallpapers, voice and signal processing)</title>

      <description>Single channel video with sound, 8.5mins&#xA;This piece playfully interrogates the idyllic picture of ‘Ireland’ that the country exports to the wider world. Though the landscape is often sold as a quaint and unspoiled haven, in reality, human over-extraction and ecological destruction dominates the landscape, and no stone is left unturned in the pursuit of capitalist gain.&#xA;‘Ireland’ leans into this uncanny deception: a slideshow of imagery pulled from a Google search of “Ireland” is overlayed with a turbulent voice and electronics sound performance – juxtaposing pixellated misrepresentations of the landscape with a volatile, harsh sonic accompaniment.</description>

      <title>Home Video (1993-2003)</title>

      <description>CRT Video Installation with sound, variable duration&#xA;‘Home Video 1993-2003’ is an audiovisual installation piece in which the artist&amp;rsquo;s family&amp;rsquo;s home VHS tapes are digitally processed and juxtaposed by a generative algorithm in realtime, and displayed on his family&amp;rsquo;s old disused CRT TV. Different times layer and blur into one another – chronology is thrown into disarray, and time becomes out of joint. The sentimental nostalgia of the home video viewing experience is abstracted, the familiarity of it is altered, in order to allow an eerie agency of time to present itself.</description>
