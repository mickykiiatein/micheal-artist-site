      <description>Concept, Director, Videography, Visual Algorithms, Editing&#xA;Watch Here&#xA;A music video which reflects the song’s anthropocene theme in an understated, locally-specific way. Generative computational techniques are utilised to collage video clips of various processes of exchange and energy transfer, and these images are brought into dialogue with the Limerick/Tipperary landscape, to inspire reflection on human processes and their cumulative impact on the local landscape. Keating also contributed lyrics and vocals to the song under the pseudonym ‘mickykiiatein’.</description>
