      <description>Sound + Single-Channel Video, Loop, 21mins&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Quarry, Ballyneety&amp;rsquo; is a quiet vocal + electronics performance responding to the deserted extraction site in County Limerick, and the wildlife now flourishing in its man-made habitat (sand martins, jackdaws, buzzards, hares among them). A peregrine falcon even makes two otherworldly interruptions during the recording. The piece was captured using a stereo pair of high-sensitivity mics and a DSLR camera.&#xA;The piece was exhibited as of &amp;lsquo;The Limerick Show&amp;rsquo; at Ormston House, 29th Nov 2024 to 1st Feb 2025.</description>

      <description>Single channel video with sound, 8.5mins&#xA;Sound Performance exploring stereotypical imagery of Irish landscapes. Images are pulled from a Google search of &amp;lsquo;Ireland&amp;rsquo;. The performance draws out an uncanny sense of Ireland as viewed by Google users. The idealised landscapes shown are undercut by a mangled voice, suggesting that all is not as quaint and bucolic as it seems in the rural Irish landscape. Initially published as an Instagram reel.</description>

      <description>Mícheál Keating, Felicia Bergstrom, Elisabeth Anna Maria Kaiser&#xA;Audiovisual interspecies performance and sculptural hanging installation, variable duration&#xA;‘Interspecies Ensemble&amp;quot; is an interdisciplinary live gallery performance that stages an intimate and ritualistic encounter between humans, plants and digital life. Human and plant actors, electroacoustic sounds and visual projections interact in a sensory ecology from which an improvised musical, theatrical and audiovisual performance emerges. The work combines contemporary technology with ancient ritualism to strive for an other-worldly techno-pagan utopia where humans, technology and nature co-exist in a sensitive and caring partnership.</description>

      <description>Single channel HD video with sound, 36.5mins&#xA;A 36 minute audiovisual artwork completed for my MA thesis, in which large volumes of digital archival materials pertaining to Limerick are combined with footage of the Limerick landscape, to explore the land as a haunted, digitally mediated palimpsest. The piece probes questions of memory, place, hauntology, nostalgia, historical narratives, temporality and the digital archive. The piece was exhibited in &amp;lsquo;The Limerick Show&amp;rsquo; (2022) in Ormston House.</description>

      <title>Home Video (1993-2003)</title>

      <description>CRT Video Installation with sound, variable duration&#xA;‘Home Video 1993-2003’ is an audiovisual installation piece in which my family&amp;rsquo;s home VHS tapes are digitally processed and juxtaposed by a generative algorithm in realtime, and displayed on my family&amp;rsquo;s old disused CRT TV. Different times layer and blur into one another – chronology is thrown into disarray, and time becomes out of joint. The sentimental nostalgia of the home video viewing experience is abstracted, the familiarity of it is altered, in order to allow an eerie agency of time to present itself.</description>
