      <description>Sound + Single-Channel Video, Loop, 21mins&#xA;&amp;lsquo;Quarry, Ballyneety&amp;rsquo; is a quiet vocal + electronics performance responding to the deserted extraction site in County Limerick, and the wildlife now flourishing in its man-made habitat (sand martins, jackdaws, buzzards, hares among them). A peregrine falcon even makes two otherworldly interruptions during the recording. The piece was captured using a stereo pair of high-sensitivity mics and a DSLR camera.&#xA;The piece was exhibited as of &amp;lsquo;The Limerick Show&amp;rsquo; at Ormston House, 29th Nov 2024 to 1st Feb 2025.</description>
